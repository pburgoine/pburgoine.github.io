      <description>Now the amount of data on the FPL website is good; everyone’s scores are public and you can see your own points week by week. However, clicking from week to week is a bit clunky and the individual player scores, located below the player’s jersey are rather small and don’t take centre stage. The page has a pitch layout as it is user friendly; it makes setting a formation, transferring players and making substitutions intuitive but it isn’t helpful for data analysis.</description>
