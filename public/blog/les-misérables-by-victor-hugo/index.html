<p>True or false, that which is said of men often occupies as important a place in their lives, and above all in their destinies, as that which they do. M. Myriel was the son of a councillor of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Aix-en-Provence">Parliament of Aix</a>; hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar. It was said that his father, destining him to be the heir of his own post, had married him at a very early age, eighteen or twenty, in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families. In spite of this marriage, however, it was said that Charles Myriel created a great deal of talk. He was well formed, though rather short in stature, elegant, graceful, intelligent; the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and
to gallantry.</p>

<p>This conversation took place in the gallery dining-room on the ground-floor. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">Bishop</a> remained silent for a moment; then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital.</p>
