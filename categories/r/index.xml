      <description>Below is a link to a bubble chart I created using Shiny apps, for the data I scraped from the FPL site. The bubbles have hover labels to reveal more information and there is a drop down to include/exclude bench points. Finally there is a slider for gameweek.

      <description>Now the amount of data on the FPL website is good; everyone’s scores are public and you can see your own points week by week. However, clicking from week to week is a bit clunky and the individual player scores, located below the player’s jersey are rather small and don’t take centre stage. The page has a pitch layout as it is user friendly; it makes setting a formation, transferring players and making substitutions intuitive but it isn’t helpful for data analysis.</description>
